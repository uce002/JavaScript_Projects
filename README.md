I'm completing the freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Certification. I've already earned a certificate in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from freeCodeCamp, but there's still more to complete as part of this certification. I want to complete this topic before moving on to React next. If you're reading this, why not hire me? üòÅ
